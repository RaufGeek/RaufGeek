## 🧠 About Me

I’m a highly analytical and detail-oriented software engineer with a strong focus on **Odoo ERP (Enterprise)**, system architecture, and clean, maintainable code.  
I work at the intersection of **business logic, backend engineering, and UX**, translating complex real-world processes into robust digital systems.

I don’t just write code — I **design systems**, **optimize workflows**, and **think in architectures**.
